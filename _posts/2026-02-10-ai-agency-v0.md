# System Status: Online
Today I successfully deployed a local **n8n** instance to handle lead automation.

## Key Achievement
* Integrated **Ollama** for private data processing.
* Reduced API costs to ₹0 for the testing phase.

```bash
# Command used to trigger the local brain
docker exec -it ollama ollama run llama3.2
